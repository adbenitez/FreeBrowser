            <h1>Welcome To FreeBrowser!</h1>
            FreeBrowser is an email-based web browser, similar in principle
            to <a href="http://tek.sourceforge.net">TEK browser</a>,
            but much more simple(it is only a client)
            and can be configured to easily use any service like
            web2mail or webpage-grabber.
            This program was made for people with limited or restricted
            Internet access that have an email account, it can be
            useful too for people from some countries that are blocked
            by some sites (ex. some google pages show a broken robot for
            people in Cuba) and for people that can't pay money for
            Internet access.
            <br/>
            <b>Note:</b> most the time the providers of the services in
            which this program relies will be in other country so your
            email account must to be able of send emails to that countries.

            <h1>How to use it</h1>
            This program requires java 1.5 or newer to work, and relies
            in a browser to show web pages.
            Before to start browsing you must go to Edit/Preferences
            menu and configure your mail settings, set your browser path
            and configure your service provider.
            After that, to visit some site: "http://example.com" you must
            to paste that url in the first text field (the larger) and
            press enter key.
            To search for something in a search engine type in the second
            text field (the smaller) and press enter key.
            You can Drag and Drop the program is window by pressing in
            the empty space of the window.
            The program will write a log file, with useful information
            about the program state, in the assets folder.
            If your mail host, or your service provider is slow,
            you can go to Tools/Games and play some HTML5 game while you
            wait for your web pages to be retrieved, the time will fly :-)

            <h1>How can I help?</h1>
            If you have internet access you can help other people
            by setting up a service like:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://github.com/fidian/webpage">
                        Webpage Grabber
                    </a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            If you haven't Internet access you can help sharing this
            program with people like you.
            <br/>
            Also anyone can help writing an email to 
            <a href="mailto:asieldbenitez@gmail.com">me</a> with emails address
            of services that can be used by this program, so a list of
            those services can be distributed along with this program.
            <br/>
            If you are a programmer or a translator and want to help with
            the development of the program, you are welcome!
