# FreeBrowser

FreeBrowser is an email-based web browser, similar in principle to [TEK browser](http://tek.sourceforge.net), but  much more simple (it
is only a client) and can be configured to easily use any service like web2mail or [webpage-grabber](https://github.com/fidian/webpage).

This program was made for people with limited or without Internet access that have an email account, it can be useful too for people
from some countries that are blocked by some sites (ex. some google pages show a broken robot for people in Cuba) and for people that
can't pay money for Internet access.

**Note:** Most the time the providers of the services in which this program relies will be in other country so your email account must
to be able of send emails to that country.

# How to use it

This program requires java 1.6 or newer to work, and relies in a browser to show web pages.
Before to start browsing you must go to Edit/Preferences menu and configure your mail settings, set your browser path (if you don't want
to use system is default browser) and configure the service of retrieving web pages (if you don't want to use default provider)
After that, to visit some site: "http://example.com" you must to paste that url in the left text field (the larger) and press enter key.
To search for something in a search engine type in the right text field (the smaller) and press enter key.
You can Drag and Drop the program is window by pressing in the empty space of the window.
The program will write a log file, with useful information about the program state, in the assets folder.
If your mail host, or your service provider is slow, you can go to Tools/Games and play some HTML5 game while you wait for your web pages
to be retrieved.

If you have internet access you can help other people by setting up a service like:
* [Webpage Grabber](https://github.com/fidian/webpage)

If you haven't Internet access you can help other people sharing this program with them.

Also anyone can help writing an email to asieldbenitez at gmail.com with emails address of services that can be used by this program, so a
list of those services can be distributed along with this program.
